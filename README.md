# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This is a basic solidty project from BUILDSPACE that implements a basic Wave Portal with a smart contract.

You can interact with the deployed smart contract with a REACT FE here:
<https://waveportal-starter-project.marinaganopols1.repl.co/>

In order to send a wave, you have to have a Metamask extension installed on your browser.

`yarn install` to install dependancies

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
    yarn clean // clean the project
    yarn compile // compile the solidity code
    yarn deploy:rinkeby // deploys the smart conract to the rinkeby chain
    yarn verify $CONTRACTADDRESS // verifies the contract address with RINKEBY ETHERSCAN
```
