# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This is a basic solidty project from BUILDSPACE that implements a basic Wave Portal with a smart contract.

You can interact with the deployed smart contract with a REACT FE here: 
https://waveportal-starter-project.marinaganopols1.repl.co/

In order to send a wave, you have to have a Metamask extension installed on your browser.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
